Possible zero-byte allocation leading to an out-of-bounds read 
=======================================

Project libssh2 Security Advisory, March 18 2019 -
[Permalink](https://www.libssh2.org/CVE-2019-3858.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

A server could send a specially crafted partial SFTP packet with a zero value
for the payload length. This zero value would be used to then allocate memory
resulting in a zero byte allocation and possible out of bounds read (CWE-130).


There are no known exploits of this flaw at this time.

INFO
----

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2019-3858 to this issue.

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: versions 0.3 up to and including 1.8.0
- Not affected versions: libssh2 >= 1.8.1

THE SOLUTION
------------

libssh2 1.8.1 ensures the length of the payload is not zero before allocing
the memory buffer using the value.


A patch for this problem is [available](https://libssh2.org/1.8.0-CVE/CVE-2019-3858.patch)

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

A - Upgrade to libssh2 1.8.1 or later

B - Apply the patch and rebuild libssh2

TIME LINE
---------

It was first reported to the libssh2 project on Dec 3 2018 by Chris Coulson.
